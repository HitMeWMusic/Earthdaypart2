# Earth Day 2023 (part 2)

I have been reflecting on the issues related to climate change and I wanted to share a few thoughts about the developments of ongoing environmental efforts, successes, failures and lessons learned.
I’ll do my best to address some of these issues while sharing the best information I can find. I apologize in advance if some of it is a bit convoluted.
This issue is one that I hold close, and it's part of the reason I went to school for Biology. I care deeply about the earth and all that we rely on for our existence. It pains me to write with such a negative bias because of the amazing things that we have lost due to past mistakes, and what kinds of global suffering we have on the horizon if we do not take this seriously.


As a science communicator, my main goal is to share information that is both informative but also useful and actionable. This entire document will not be for everybody, but if I can motivate or change a single mind to think differently on this, that is reason enough to do it.


It’s important to reassess our efforts and evaluate what actions have the most impact, and what changes we can make that can benefit the cause in the long term. After all, this is a long game, and we must often re-evaluate our near-term goals and weigh them against the long term vision.

When speaking on this topic, I feel it's necessary to address it by highlighting the downside risks, but after much thought I can see how that alone does not inspire actionable change. 
I realize more after witnessing the successes of other campaigns that there is a powerful effect to incentivizing change in a positive manner but also separating it to smaller targets that seem more manageable.
When we break down a massive goal into its components, we have to look at the behaviors and habits that can help get us there. We have to decide what amount of change we can afford while remaining on track. Stopping the practices that affect climate change and reversing the damage are goals worth educating, sharing, and coordinating whatever resources we have at our disposal. 

It's incredibly hard to “stop” doing anything. Try this right now:
Try NOT thinking about a tomato for 5 seconds. Did it work?
The mind doesn't understand it “won’t” do something anymore, but replacing that with a new piece of information helps fill that void. To create sustained change we should analyze our outdated and detrimental habits and replace them with new ones.
Generations of small and sustainable change lead to reliably impressive results that seemed out of reach at the start. 
The reason this ground-up approach works so well is action doesn’t always follow motivation, rather it works the other way around. It’s the momentum from small and consistent steps that can provide the motivation and momentum to modify and replace these choices with more optimal ones. 
I’m sure this isn’t new information for many, but the question remains, “how do we put this into practice?”
There is no single right answer here. 

Depending on where you live, and what resources you have at your disposal, you might choose to walk to work or bike to school. you might choose to save up for an electric vehicle or other mode of transportation. When you buy a home, you might choose to invest in solar panels, giving you the ability to save money in the long run, and potentially sell excess power back to your electric company when you are producing more than you are consuming.
If you own a business, you may have a bit more choices at your disposal with sourcing materials that are biodegradable, buying carbon credits, or donating to organizations and creating strategic partnerships. If you feel that none of those are feasible options, start with educating yourself and those around you. Get to know the barriers in place in your own life and others and see what workarounds you can find.
People's time is limited, daily life struggles and our shrinking attention span affects our ability to stay on task. We tend  to get swept up in the weekly crisis that redirects our attention away from larger goals.

Our brains have a hard time detecting a threat if it isn’t in our immediate view. It's why the majority of us react much more intensely to news of a shark attack at a local beach, but are relatively underwhelmed about the slow decay of our physical bodies from our daily habits. Even when we are presented with a frightening medical diagnosis, many patients will return home unchanged on the same path.
We prefer a familiar but somewhat comfortable hell to an uncertain change that may have a much more favorable outcome.
One of the key assets to our survival is to train our societies and our children to be more math and science (STEM) literate. A society that understands statistics and probabilistic outcomes can fare much better when facing complex issues. Without that foundation, it isn’t likely we will create adequate mental models that can steer us in the right direction. The reality of the situation with climate change might not be intuitive, the idea that the climate is on a path toward mass extinction doesn’t map to our daily experience where things are mostly “OK”. It's really important to not fall prey to fallacious thinking and logical fallacies. I won't go into detail on those here, but if you want to get more familiar with them you can read about them here> https://theconversation.com/how-to-use-critical-thinking-to-spot-false-climate-claims-91314

Scientific literacy and communication to the public needs reform as well. Scientists often lose touch with public audiences, which can be frustrating for both parties. It's important to inform the public but when you are steeped in that world it can be hard to communicate that in a manner that resonates with the common person. The majority of the people in the world are not scientists, so we have to find new approaches to making the information informative and accessible while also not being overwhelming. This is where I think more work needs to be done. We need more science communicators making content and sharing this information in new and interesting ways. If you are a content creator, using your platform to share it is a worthy and important contribution. Your words and reach has value that can’t be quantified.


While there are a lot of barriers here, and we still have a long way to go, it's important to celebrate the wins as well. The past years have yielded some incredible breakthroughs worth highlighting.
 
Here are a few awesome things that are worth celebrating: 

- Solar Power Efficiency: The efficiency of solar cells has increased significantly over the years, from about 1% in the 1950s to over 20% today. In 2016, perovskite solar cells, achieved a record efficiency of 26.3%.

- Wind Turbine Technology: In addition to becoming more widespread, wind turbines have become more efficient and cost-effective, with larger and more powerful turbines being developed. In 2018, GE announced the development of the world's most powerful offshore wind turbine, the Haliade-X, with a capacity of 12 MW.

- Energy Storage: Energy storage has become a crucial component in the transition to renewable energy. Advances in battery technology, such as lithium-ion batteries, have made it possible to store energy on a large scale. In 2021, Tesla announced the development of a new battery technology, called the Tesla 4680, which could significantly increase the energy capacity of batteries.

- Carbon Capture and Storage: Carbon capture and storage technology aims to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other industrial processes, and store them underground. In 2020, the world's largest CCS facility, the Gorgon Project in Australia.

- Climate Modeling: Climate modeling has improved significantly in recent years, with scientists using supercomputers to simulate climate scenarios and predict future climate patterns. In 2021, researchers from the UK and US used a supercomputer to simulate the Earth's climate for the next 1,000 years, providing a better understanding of the long-term impacts of climate change.

- Electric Vehicles: The development of electric vehicles has made it possible to reduce carbon emissions from transportation. Advances in battery technology have made it possible for EVs to have longer ranges and faster charging times. A new EV battery technology called solid-state batteries, was developed, which could significantly increase the range of EVs.

- Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Hydrogen fuel cells convert hydrogen into electricity, with the only byproduct being water. Advances in fuel cell technology have made it possible to use hydrogen as a clean source of energy. In 2021, Hyundai introduced the Ioniq 5, the world's first mass-produced vehicle with a hydrogen fuel cell.

These breakthroughs and others are helping to accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy, and hold the promise of a brighter future for the planet.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you reading and hank you for your time. If you feel that any part of this resonates with you, please share or talk about this with someone.
We are all in this together.
